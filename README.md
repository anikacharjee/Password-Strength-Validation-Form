# Password Strength Validation Form

This project is a simple web-based sign-up form with live password strength validation. It checks for the presence of an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character, and minimum length of 8 characters. The **Sign Up** button is enabled only when all these criteria are met.

---

## Features

- Live password validation feedback as you type.
- Visual indicators (✔ and ✖) for each password rule.
- Submit button disabled until all password requirements are fulfilled.
- Basic, clean, and responsive design.

---

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML page containing the sign-up form.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the form and validation indicators.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for real-time password checks and enabling/disabling the submit button.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Make sure all three files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`) are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
4. Start typing in the password field. The validation list will update with ticks (✔) and crosses (✖).
5. When all password criteria are met, the **Sign Up** button becomes enabled.
