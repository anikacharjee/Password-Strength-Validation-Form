# Password-Strength-Validation-Form
This project is a simple web-based sign-up form with live password strength validation. It checks for the presence of an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character, and minimum length of 8 characters. The Sign Up button is enabled only when all these criteria are met.
